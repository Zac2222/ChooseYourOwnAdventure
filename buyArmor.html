    <p>You arrive in the item shop and see the walls covered in gear. Everything from armor to weapons and even field items like ropes and tents. You talk to the shop keeping and ask for some warrior armor and a powerful sword. Geared and ready to set off on your quest.</p>
    <p>You arrive at the dragons lair and look up at your enemy. The dragon is huge and imposing as it looks down at you. It tries to attack with a wall of fire but your armor can absorb most of the damage, hot as it may be. You strike back with one clean swing of your mighty blade and take the dragon down. The princess is saved and you return to town together to celebrate!</p>
    <p class="good">Good End!</p>
