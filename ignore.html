    <p>You ignore the potion sellers warning and attempt to barter with him until he eventually gives in despite knowing your fate</p>
    <p>You continue onward on your quest to rescue the princess. As you enter the dragons lair and look up at what you must overcome. You think to yourself some armor or any kind of weapon to fight with at all would have been nice right about now. You reach into your back and drink the potion. Quickly you can feel your strength growing and you think you might have a chance. Just as you have that though you realize that feeling of power inside you has not stopped growing. You are so overcome with power that your body cant withstand it and you fall to the ground. With your heart beating rapidly you realize you are about to meet your end before the dragon even attacks. As you take your final breath you realize this potion was in fact too strong for you.</p>
