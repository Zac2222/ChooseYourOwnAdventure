    <p>As you arrive in town you see countless shops. There is a shop for everything and for everyone. You see magical items and even gear for assassins. You realize you might need to gear up if you want a chance to defeat the dragon. Or maybe you can take up a side quest for possibly a stronger reward.</p>
    <a class="left" href="/buyItems.html">It's good to come prepared, I should check the shops...</a>
    <a class="right" href="/sideQuest.html">Maybe an extra quest can help me become stronger...</a>
